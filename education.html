                        This school was really the start of my musical career. My father is a music producer, so I've been around music
                        for most of my life. But it wasn't until I joined the Annie Gale Jazz Band that I really had the chance to explore
                        music and play with a group of people. The then band instructor, Mr. O, has been a wonderful influence on my life.
                        I played Saxophone for the first year and later became their pianist. I've got great memories here!

                        This was the first time I had a school actually within walking distance of my house! My knowledge of music
                        expanded as I joined the concert band of Nelson Mandela. I would also finally get deeper into animation and
                        programming through joining dedicated classes to each. Unfortunately, all three of my years here would be in
                        the middle of COVID, so playing was rather difficult. But it didn't deter me!

                        Right now I'm in my first year and second semester of my Bachelor of Computer Information Systems degree!
                        It's been tough, but I think I'm getting along quite well. Naturally, the classes I've dealt with include
                        Introduction to Programming, Web Design, and Marketing, although I hope to soon take some music courses once
                        it becomes time for choosing electives!
